## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic ship. The dataset includes features such as the passenger's name, age, sex, fare, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is used for classification problems, where the goal is to predict if a passenger survived or not based on their attributes.

## Input Features
- `PassengerId`: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- `Pclass`: The class of the passenger (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- `Name`: The name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: The gender of the passenger (male or female).
- `Age`: The age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: The number of siblings or spouses aboard.
- `Parch`: The number of parents or children aboard.
- `Fare`: The fare paid by the passenger.
- `Embarked`: The port where the passenger boarded (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Special Works
Performed Extra Dataset Analysis and 3-way dataset split

## Output Labels
- `Survived`: This is the output label. It indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).
